// PATCH
//
// The Server SHOULD accept PATCH requests against any upload URL and
// apply the bytes contained in the message at the given offset
// specified by the Upload-Offset header. All PATCH requests MUST use
// Content-Type: application/offset+octet-stream.
//
// The Upload-Offset headerâ€™s value MUST be equal to the current offset
// of the resource. In order to achieve parallel upload the
// Concatenation extension MAY be used. If the offsets do not match, the
// Server MUST respond with the 409 Conflict status without modifying
// the upload resource.
//
// The Client SHOULD send all the remaining bytes of an upload in a
// single PATCH request, but MAY also use multiple small requests
// successively for scenarios where this is desirable, for example, if
// the Checksum extension is used.
//
// The Server MUST acknowledge successful PATCH requests with the 204 No
// Content status. It MUST include the Upload-Offset header containing
// the new offset. The new offset MUST be the sum of the offset before
// the PATCH request and the number of bytes received and processed or
// stored during the current PATCH request.
//
// Both, Client and Server, SHOULD attempt to detect and handle network
// errors predictably. They MAY do so by checking for read/write socket
// errors, as well as setting read/write timeouts. A timeout SHOULD be
// handled by closing the underlying connection.
//
// The Server SHOULD always attempt to store as much of the received
// data as possible.
